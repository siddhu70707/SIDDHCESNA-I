## Purpose

The purpose of **SIDDHCESNA-1** is to demonstrate how **high-level programming instructions are executed by real hardware** at the binary level.

This project was built to:
- Bridge the gap between **software and hardware**
- Provide a **hands-on understanding** of CPU arithmetic operations
- Serve as an **educational model** for learning computer architecture

### Objectives
- To design and build a **fully functional 8-bit ALU** using discrete hardware components
- To implement **addition and subtraction** using real logic circuits
- To demonstrate **2’s complement subtraction** without relying on optimized tricks
- To show how **opcodes control hardware behavior**
- To create a custom compiler (**Scesna/C++**) that converts human-readable code into machine-level binary

### Educational Goal
Rather than focusing on performance or miniaturization, SIDDHCESNA-1 prioritizes:
- Clarity of design
- Logical correctness
- Ease of understanding for students

This makes the project suitable for **school demonstrations, exhibitions, and learning computer fundamentals**.

In short, **SIDDHCESNA-1** exists to show that computers are not magic — they are logical machines built from simple operations working together.
